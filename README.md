<h3 align="left"> Data Scientist | Ph.D. Student | University of Wisconsin- Madison</h3>

I am a graduate student at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I obtained my bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM). In the summer of 2022, I started to work as a graduate research assistant at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am collaborating with the Analytics for Human Development Lab, Zayas-Caban Lab, and UW Health on a project to improve the operations of healthcare systems using machine learning and operations research.

In my free time I like to pursue my own open source projects to contribute to our society through code. Some of my recent works include an open source Python package for statistical process control and an open source web scraping script to monitor power outages in Puerto Rico.
